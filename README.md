## Introduction

We present a novel framework for efficient time series forecasting in edge computing. It departs from traditional, resource-intensive deep learning methods, embracing hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for a more efficient approach. The framework includes two models: the Autoregressive Hyperdimensional Computing (AR-HDC) and the Sequence-to-Sequence HDC (Seq2Seq-HDC). These models are designed to reduce inference times and improve accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting, making them ideal for resource-limited edge computing scenarios
